TITLE: Scrapify – A Digital Marketplace for Local Scrap Buyers and Household Sellers.

OBJECTIVE:The traditional scrap trading system is largely unorganized, offline, and inefficient. There is no centralized digital platform connecting scrap sellers and buyers, leading to pricing inefficiencies, lack of transparency, manual negotiations, and unstructured pickup management. A secure and automated solution is needed to streamline scrap trading and improve transparency, efficiency, and accessibility.
